# Hull building

I have almost zero experience in designing neither buiding boat hull. During the building, I made quite a few mistakes.

## Hull desgining in Fusion 360

There are some points that need to take care about when designing the hull. 

- The hull should be as skinny as possible. To lower the drag, also allow my 3D printer to print the segment (<18cm diameter).  
- However, the deck area should be large enough to hold as much solar panels as possible.

A smaller boat require less materials to build, which will always lower the cost. So I basically designed the deck that can host the minimum number of required solar panels. 
A single panel size 11 x 13 cm, generate peak power of 2W. Per the preliminary calculation, we will need at least 8 of them. 

Since the boat will sail in a lower speed, so a displacement hull will be a good choice. Here is the design.



Total buoyancy: around 10kg

Length: 1100mm

Width: 140mm

Height: 90mm
